## Overview

### What This Application Does

My Word Bank is a simple web-based application that allows users to search for the definitions of words and save them to their own custom glossary How it works is pretty straightforward: 

The user searches for a word and displays all definitions and examples in tables. There, he/she can choose a definition that they like and save it to the glossary. If no definitions are found, then the user can be redirected to Goolge search.

The user has the ability to display the glossary of saved terms as a table. In addition to that, at any time, a user is allowed to modify any entries or simply remove them.

### Why This Application was Created

This application was created as part of my Flatiron School Phase 1 project. I chose to create this application, because I believe that many people tend to forget the meanings of new words that they have learned, and there are times where searching for definitions of word requires the tedious task of clicking more links. I wish to reduce the number of clicks made just to find the right definition of a word that a user is looking for. It also helps to review any words that you recently learned by viewing your glossary instead of having to search for them one at a time. This is what makes this application unique from other dictionary websites.

### Technologies

There are several technologies used to create this application: Firstly, the languages chosen were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All code is enclosed in only one file for each language, meaning that in this project, there is only one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. It was written this way because a purpose this simple did not require more complications by adding more unnecessary code files. In addition the languages, the glossary is stored in a JSON file. 

By modifying the glossary, the user is modifying the JSON file itself. The last notable technology is the <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/" target="_blank">Free Dictionary API</a>. This API is what powers the word search functionality for this application. If you search for a word using the API, the result returned is a large, complex object that in most cases, contains the following:

<ul>
    <li>Many definitions</li>
    <li>Some examples (depends on the word)</li>
    <li>The word's pronunciation:
        <ul>
            <li>IPA reading</li>
            <li>Audio file</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Synonyms and antonyms</li>
</ul>

### Limitations
Although this application functions as expected, there are some challenges that you need to be aware of:

<ol>
    <li>Not all words will be found in the API. For example: the words, <strong>xyst</strong>, and <strong>drab</strong>, although are real words, they do not exist in the API. Fortunately, however, the event of receiving no results for an actual word search is rare.</li><br/>
    <li>Unfortunately, not all words have a playable audio file to hear its pronunciation, which means, you would have to search for it outside this application.</li><br/>
    <li>Only a few definitions displayed to the user have example sentences. Most definitions are without examples. Perhaps it is because most definitions are rather similar to each other, that the creators of the API feel not the need to add an example for each definition. This is only a theory, so take this with a grain of salt.</li><br/>
    <li>When you wish to add a word to the glossary, or modify a saved word, a form will prompt the user to make the changes that he/she desires. More on this form later. Admittedly, the styling is not the best, but I have tried to style it as best as I could.</li>
</ol>

## Installation & Execution

### Saving a Copy of the Project onto Your Local Machine

The good news is that installing this application is quite easy. This project is saved in my <a href="https://github.com/adnanian/atw-flatiron-phase-1-project" target="_blank">Flatiron School Phase 1 Project</a>. Please ensure that you have a GitHub account before attempting to install this application onto your local machine. Also ensure that you have Git installed on your local machine as well. If you don't, refer to <a href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git" target="_blank">this help guide here.</a>

Once you have ensured the above two checks have passed, then all that's left is for you to fork and clone this repository. For those who are not as familiar with GitHub, here is a quick <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fork-and-clone-in-github/" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks guide on forking and cloning</a>.

### Running the Project

To run the project, <b>open up your terminal</b>. Then, navigate to the directory where you have the repository cloned, and open the project. I stronly recommend opening this project with <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, but you may use any other application (such as Notepad++) of your choosing as long as you're able to open up the HTML file on your browser. <b>DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL YET!</b>

Once the project is opened, you will need to ensure that you have that you have the JSON server installed onto your machine. If you don't, then type in the following command onto your terminal, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>: <code>npm install -g json-server</code>

Once you have ensured that the JSON server is installed, you'll have to run it in the directory where you cloned the repository. Enter this command in that directory: <code>json-server â€“watch db.json</code>

If you are following my recommendation, open up the terminal on VS code and type: <code>explorer.exe index.html</code>

If you see the following page open up on your browser, then you have followed all instructions correctly:

## Usage

As stated before, using this application is very straightforward. In this section, we will walkthrough with you each feature for this application.

### Searching for a Word
<ol>
    <li>Type in a word in the search bar. Then press ENTER or click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.<br/><img src="./images/Word Search Example.png" alt="Word Search Example"/></li>
</ol>

#### Search Results Found
<ol>
    <li>If the word exists in the Free Dictionary API, you should see a result like this below:<br/><img src="./images/Result Display Example.png" alt="Result Display Example"/></li>
    <li>Hover over the IPA to hear how the word is pronounced. The IPA will turn red and an audio file should automatically play the pronunciation to you.<br/><img src="./images/Hover for Pronunciation.png" alt="Hover for pronunciation."/></li>
    <li>Scroll through each definition in the tables displayed and choose a definition that you like. Each definition is indexed by a category number enclosed in a yellow button. To add a word, click on the yellow button adjacent to the definition.<br/><img src="./images/Choose a Word to Save.png" alt="Choose a Word to Save"/></li>
    <li>Once you clicked on a button to save a word, a green form with black text will be displayed to you, prompting you to confirm that you want to save the word with the current phonetic pronunciation, definition, and example. You may make modifications to these fields before submitting, and this will be updated to your glossary. However, note that you wouldn't be modifying the objects from the API itself. Click <strong>Submit</strong>, once you're finished.<br/><img src="./images/Glossary Form.png" alt="Add a word to the glossary example."/></li>
</ol>

#### Search Results Not Found
<ol>
    <li>If the word does not exist in the API, you will see a result as shown in the picture below. <b>Note:</b> the word, "nein", is German, but this is simply for demonstrative purposes. If you are confident that the word exists, below is a yellow button, which will take you to a definition search on Google in a new tab.<br/><img src="./images/No Result Display Example.png" alt="Example of a search result not being found."/></li>
</ol>
